# Insult generator
Here's a quick and simple *insult generator* written in pure Javascript.

The generator generates three words at random in the format `WordA` + `WordB` `WordC`, and the type of words generated are controlled by the `smart` and `dirty` sliders. The `smart` slider controls what type of `WordA` is returned (at three levels) and the `dirty` slider controls what type of `WordB` is returned (again at three levels).

This gave me a good opportunity to practise styling the HTML `input type="range"` sliders, and I would like to credit [this post from CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/styling-cross-browser-compatible-range-inputs-css/) for help with this :-)

Have fun insulting!
